<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I‘m a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Florida International University (FIU), where I work as a Graduate Research&Teaching Assistant in Dr. Ou Bai’s Human Cyber-Physical Systems (HCPS) Laboratory. My research focuses on the intersection of Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Embedded Systems, and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), with an emphasis on real-time, resource-constrained, and wearable AI systems. I have published research in venues across multimedia, biometrics, computer vision, and natural language processing at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k--3fM4AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.

Currently, I'm working on an AI-powered wearable multimodal multi-task real-time dynamic behavior analysis system, aiming to integrate perception, reasoning, and decision-making into embedded and edge AI platforms. Particularly interested in efficient multimodal LLM inference, model compression, and edge/embedded AI deployment, with the goal of enabling intelligent systems to operate reliably under strict latency, computation, and energy constraints. My research has been applied to a range of real-world cyber-physical systems, including wearable exoskeletons, multimodal emotion recognition, and human–AI interaction systems.

[Label Ranker: Self-aware Preference for Classification Label Position in Visual Masked Self-supervised Pre-trained Model](https://doi.org/10.1145/3731715.3733369)

**Peihao Xiang**, Kaida Wu, Ou Bai

ACM 15th International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval

30 June - 3 July, 2025 \| Chicago, IL, USA

[[**ICMR 2025**](https://www.icmr-2025.org/)][[**Paper**](https://doi.org/10.1145/3731715.3733369)][[**Preprints**](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202503.0003)][[**Code**](https://github.com/Peihao-Xiang/Label-Ranker)][[**Video**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MhP51vQf-NjJPpR_13V6N2MW46kTq67b/view?usp=drive_link)]
- Label Ranker introduces a self-aware label positioning mechanism for visual masked self-supervised pre-trained models (e.g., MAE-style architectures). It observes that the position at which a classification label (or token) is injected into the model significantly affects downstream performance, yet is usually treated as a fixed or arbitrary design choice.

[MultiMAE-DER: Multimodal Masked Autoencoder for Dynamic Emotion Recognition](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPRS62101.2024.10677820)

**Peihao Xiang**, Chaohao Lin, Kaida Wu, Ou Bai

IEEE 14th International Conference on Pattern Recognition Systems

15-18 July, 2024 \| University of Westminster, London, UK

[[**ICPRS 2024**](http://s836450039.websitehome.co.uk/icprs24/index.html#intro)][[**Paper**](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPRS62101.2024.10677820)][[**arXiv**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18327)][[**Code**](https://github.com/Peihao-Xiang/MultiMAE-DER)][[**Video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqaTGxtQaEo)]
- MultiMAE-DER proposes a multimodal masked autoencoder framework for dynamic emotion recognition (DER) that learns robust temporal–emotional representations by jointly modeling multiple modalities (e.g., visual, audio, and physiological signals).
